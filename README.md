# Error Handling Example Smart Contract

## Description
This Solidity smart contract serves as an example of error handling techniques in Ethereum smart contract development. The contract includes functions demonstrating the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements to enforce conditions and handle errors.

## Features
- The contract has an `owner` and a `value`.
- The `setValue` function can only be called by the owner and enforces conditions using `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements.
- The `getValue` function allows anyone to view the current value.

## Usage
To run this smart contract, you can follow these steps:

1. Use a Solidity development environment, such as Remix, to deploy and interact with the contract.
2. Deploy the contract and interact with the `setValue` and `getValue` functions.

## Getting Started
To deploy and interact with the smart contract, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Smart Contract:**
   - Open Remix and create a new file (e.g., `ErrorHandlingExample.sol`).
   - Copy and paste the provided Solidity code into the file.
   - Compile the code using the "Solidity Compiler" tab.

2. **Deploy the Smart Contract:**
   - Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
   - Select the `ErrorHandlingExample` contract from the dropdown.
   - Click the "Deploy" button.

3. **Interact with the Smart Contract:**
   - After deployment, you can interact with the contract.
   - Call the `setValue` function to update the value while considering the error conditions.
   - Call the `getValue` function to retrieve the current value.
